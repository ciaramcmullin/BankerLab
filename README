For Lab 3, I have submitted a project called Banker Lab, which contains three classes: Activity, Banker, and Task.
The Banker class is the main class. It reads the input and holds the Optimistic resource manager and Banker's algorithms
along with their helper classes. The Activity holds the information of the activities for their corresponding tasks. The
task class holds the information about each process. They are sorted based on the task ID, which start at 1. I wrote this
code on IntelliJ. To run this program please open project on IntelliJ or another text editor like Sublime. In the terminal,
type: javac Banker.java. The type java Banker input-file-name. The input file name must be valid or else the the exception
will be caught and my program will print an error messaged and exit.
